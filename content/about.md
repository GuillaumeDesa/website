As of September 2023, I will be full professor of English Linguistics at [Bordeaux-Montaigne University](https://www.u-bordeaux-montaigne.fr/fr/universite/organisation/unites_de_formation/langues_et_civilisations/etudes-des-mondes-anglophones.html). I am looking forward to joining my new lab: [CLIMAS](https://climas.u-bordeaux-montaigne.fr/).

Between 2006 and 2023, I was associate professor of Linguistics at [Paris 8 University](https://www.univ-paris8.fr/), France. I was also a researcher at the [MoDyCo laboratory](https://www.modyco.fr/fr/) of the [University of Paris Nanterre](https://www.parisnanterre.fr/). 

I hold a PhD from Bordeaux-Montaigne University and a Habilitation from Universit√© de Paris. 

I am the recipient of a 5-year honorary position (2017-2022) at the [Institut Universitaire de France](https://www.iufrance.fr/les-membres-de-liuf/membre/1778-guillaume-desagulier.html), a division of the French Ministry of Higher Education that distinguishes university professors for their research excellence.

I am interested in cognitive linguistics, construction grammar, corpus linguistics, sociolinguistics, and language change. I have published extensively on (Diachronic) Construction Grammar.
 
I am the author of a reference textbook on corpus linguistics with R: [*Corpus Linguistics and Statistics with R*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-64572-8) (New York: Springer).

I have a research blog: [Around the word, A corpus linguist's notebook](https://corpling.hypotheses.org/), where I record reflections and experiments on my practice as a usage-based corpus linguist.

I am the current editor-in-chief of [*CogniTextes*](https://journals.openedition.org/cognitextes/), the journal of the [French Cognitive Linguistics Association](http://www.aflico.fr/en/).
