I am Associate Professor of English Linguistics at [Paris 8 University](https://www.univ-paris8.fr/), France. I am also a researcher at the [MoDyCo laboratory](https://www.modyco.fr/fr/) of the [University of Paris Nanterre](https://www.parisnanterre.fr/). I hold a PhD in English linguistics from Bordeaux University and an Habilitation from the Universit√© de Paris.

I am the recipient of a 5-year honorary position (2017-2022) at the [Institut Universitaire de France](https://www.iufrance.fr/les-membres-de-liuf/membre/1778-guillaume-desagulier.html), a division of the French Ministry of Higher Education that distinguishes university professors for their research excellence.

I am interested in cognitive linguistics, corpus linguistics, construction grammar, sociolinguistics, and language change.
 
I am the author of a reference textbook on corpus linguistics with R: [*Corpus Linguistics and Statistics with R*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-64572-8) (New York: Springer).

I have a research blog: [Around the word, A corpus linguist's notebook](https://corpling.hypotheses.org/), where I record reflections and experiments on my practice as a usage-based corpus linguist.
