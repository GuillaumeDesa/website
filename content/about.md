title: Bio
---

I have been Associate Professor of Linguistics at [Paris 8 University](https://www.univ-paris8.fr/), France, since 2006. I am also a researcher at the [MoDyCo laboratory](https://www.modyco.fr/fr/) of the [University of Paris Nanterre](https://www.parisnanterre.fr/).

I am the recipient of a 5-year honorary position (2017-2022) at the [Institut Universitaire de France](https://www.iufrance.fr/les-membres-de-liuf/membre/1778-guillaume-desagulier.html), a division of the French Ministry of Higher Education that distinguishes university professors for their research excellence.
 
My research interests are at the crossroads of cognitive linguistics and corpus linguistics. More specifically, I use corpus-linguistics and statistical techniques to test usage-based hypotheses. I have published widely on (Diachronic) Construction Grammar.
 
I am the author of a reference textbook on corpus linguistics with R: [*Corpus Linguistics and Statistics with R*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-64572-8) (New York: Springer).

I have a research blog: [Around the word, A corpus linguist's notebook](https://corpling.hypotheses.org/), where I record reflections and experiments on my practice as a usage-based corpus linguist.
