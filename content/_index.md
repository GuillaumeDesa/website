I am Associate Professor of English Linguistics at [Paris 8 University](https://www.univ-paris8.fr/), France. I am also a researcher at the [MoDyCo laboratory](https://www.modyco.fr/fr/) of the [University of Paris Nanterre](https://www.parisnanterre.fr/). I hold a [PhD in English linguistics](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01393210/document) from Bordeaux University and an [Habilitation](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01657598/document) from the Universit√© de Paris. I am the recipient of a 5-year honorary position (2017-2022) at the [Institut Universitaire de France](https://www.iufrance.fr/les-membres-de-liuf/membre/1778-guillaume-desagulier.html), a division of the French Ministry of Higher Education that distinguishes university professors for their research excellence. 

I am interested in cognitive linguistics, corpus linguistics, construction grammar, sociolinguistics, and language change.
 
I am the author of a reference textbook on corpus linguistics with R: [*Corpus Linguistics and Statistics with R*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-64572-8) (New York: Springer). I have a research blog: [Around the word, A corpus linguist's notebook](https://corpling.hypotheses.org/), where I record reflections and experiments on my practice as a usage-based corpus linguist. I am the current editor-in-chief of [*CogniTextes*](https://journals.openedition.org/cognitextes/), the journal of the [French Cognitive Linguistics Association](http://www.aflico.fr/en/).

This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backwards compatible with the initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```
